# Building

A production build can be made from a functional dev environment by running `npm run build`. This build can be started as a webserver using `npm run start`. Be sure to set your `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` and `AUTH_TRUST_HOST` correctly, and configure a postgres database in `.env`. See [Environment.md](./Environment.md)
